# Simple Custom action for learning

**Simple Greeting Action** is a lightweight custom GitHub Action designed to demonstrate how composite actions work.  
This action accepts a user’s name and environment as inputs, prints a greeting message, and exposes a reusable output that can be consumed in subsequent workflow steps.

It is intentionally simple, making it ideal for:
- Learning custom action structure

- Demonstrating inputs, outputs, and step execution
